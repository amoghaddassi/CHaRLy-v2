# CHaRLy-v2
Second version of the curiosity driven, hierarchal reinforcement learning (CHaRLy) task that tests participants in reactive and transfer conditions. This repo holds all files from building the experiment to data analysis and modeling:
- task(-2.1 or 2.2): This contains code for the live task that research participants will play. 2.2 is most recent iteration.
- analysis: Scripts for analyzing behavioral data.
- models: Not much there yet. Will be where all RL (and maybe more) models for the task live.
