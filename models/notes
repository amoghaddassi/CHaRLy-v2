Running notes file as I build the modeling code for the charly task.

Just started on this by setting up some abstract classes and the agent environment interaction loop.

Think a good place to start is to implement the charly task using this environment API.
For starters, this means working out a logical board representation for the game. This will be necessary for
both the agent to compute values and for the environment to update itself.
Want to include all the information that would be visually presented to participants, which includes:
- previous key strokes.
- middle layer items that appear.
- whether a star was unlocked.
- whether points were recieved.

Why not just make a super simple data structure that has all this info? Good starting point at least.
