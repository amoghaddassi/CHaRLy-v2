"""
The tutorial is organized by the screens that the user sees:
screen1: Goal is to collect coins
screen2: Machince is how you make those coins
screen3: Interact with machine to produce smoke
screen4: Interact with machine to produce coin
screen5: Questions?

runTutorial: main function that runs all screens in the
correct order

The only argument for all functions is the window to draw.
